# Dom Operations
Document Object Model
to access the html elements and the tags we need this model

>> Its a representation of a web tree


Example: 
<html>
<head>
<title></title>
</head>
<body>
<h1></h1>
</body>
</html>

Dom is a representation of the above flow
Representation:(For our estimation)
                html
        head            body
           title          h1



Bootstrap:(refer the library https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/ for any cards or buttons or others as well)
It is required for this project
Till date we have css for styling 
Not writing all the lines 
we will use this library to import the styles and use 

>> we will only write the class name without defining the styles as they will already be defined

To have that you need two lines of code to use it in link and script tags
example with button 

 <!-- class btn btn-primary is for setting the styles -->
<!-- <button class="btn btn-primary">Click on me</button> -->

we can have the predefined class and name it in the class= "btn btn-success"



different technical names are there like card modal carousel and others we can use it wisely
